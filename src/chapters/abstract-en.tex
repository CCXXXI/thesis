    Heart disease has overtaken all other causes of death in the population in recent years due to an increase in prevalence.
    A crucial tool for the early diagnosis of cardiovascular disorders is ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring.
    The demand for mobile ECG monitoring applications is increasing significantly as a result of the acceptance of smaller wearable Holter monitoring devices and the proliferation of mobile devices.
    On the other hand, the abundance of ambulatory ECG data has increased the need for automatic ECG analysis algorithms, and numerous artificial intelligence ambulatory ECG analysis algorithms have evolved as a result of the quick development of deep learning models.

    Based on the existing dynamic ECG artificial intelligence analysis algorithms and mobile application development technologies, this project designed and implemented a wearable dynamic ECG intelligent monitoring application for mobile terminals.
    The Flutter cross-platform framework, which supports the two most popular mobile operating systems, Android and iOS, is the foundation for the development of the application.
    The LibTorch framework serves as the foundation for the algorithmic portion of model porting.
    The application offers users simple and beautiful interface design, clear and complete functions, and ease of use.
    It also offers users ECG, heart rate, analysis report, and device management functions.
